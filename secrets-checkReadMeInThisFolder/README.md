# Rename the folder to `secrets` before doing anything else, making sure it's ignored by git!


## GitHub Container Registry Token
To run the `quick-start-test.sh` script, you'll need to set up the `ghcr-container-registry.read.yml` secret in the `secrets/kubernetes/development` folder.
This secret allows the grouphq minikube cluster to pull images from the GitHub container registry.

To set up the secret, you'll need to create a GitHub personal access token with the `read:packages` scope.

Once you have the token, [follow the instructions here to create the secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#registry-secret-existing-credentials).
Hint: The guide linked above assumes you already have kubectl set to a cluster context. You can start up
the local cluster using the script to follow the guide. The script step applying the secret will fail, but that
shouldn't stop you from following the guide. Then you can either manually apply the secret, or run the script again.

## Let's Encrypt Digital Ocean Access Token (production only)
This secret should exist in production. It uses an access token generated by Digital Ocean to allow communication between cert-manager and Digital Ocean's DNS API.
The access token needs to have both read _and_ write access.

If you're configuring Let's Encrypt for production, then add the access token and apply the secret to the cluster using the following command:
```shell
kubectl apply -f production/letsencrypt-digital-ocean-access-token.yml
```

## OpenAI API Key (production only)
This secret should exist in production if OpenAI integration is enabled.

If you're configuring OpenAI for production, then add the API key and apply the secret to the cluster using the following command:
```commandline
kubectl apply -f production/openai-api-key.yml
```
